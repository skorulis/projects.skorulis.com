### Brief

This website you're looking at right now dispalys the various projects that I'm working on.

### Prioritised Backlog

* Add r/skorulis as a project
* Add icons for the status of the project
* Add backlogs to each project
* Create an about page
* Pull down information listing the size of the repository
* Make this site look less shit
    * Investigate using Tailwind for this
* Put screenshots in a some sort of carousel rather than in the markdown
* Add a start date to projects
* Add analytics 

### Tech

* React
* Markdown
