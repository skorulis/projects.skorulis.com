### Brief

My biggest challenge in all my apps and websites is that they look pretty shit. To help with this I need to build a design system which I can reuse across my projects which should make it easy for each app to have fairly professional designs without any more effort than I'm currently investing to build them.

ASKDesignSystem will probably replace ASSwiftUI since the focus is much the same.

The hardest part will be making a design system which doesn't look awful and fits nicely across multiple apps.

## Concerns

Am I better to just take an existing design system?
