### Brief

If you want to get better at something it's important to keep track of where you're at. This app allows tracking the record for an activity over time.

### Competition

There's a few other apps out there that do this, but the bar isn't too high.

### Prioritised backlog

* Show graphs for volume and variant records
* Allow adding new activities
* Understand what is wrong with the nav bar on the transition to the next page
* Improve where variants can be added
* Remove old code
* Fix build failures in unit tests
* Add icons for workouts. Will do a lot for the visual appeal
    - Maybe categories have icons and activities can override if needed.


### Future possibilities

* Social interaction and sharing data between devices

### Tech

* SwiftUI
* SwiftUI charts
* Core data
