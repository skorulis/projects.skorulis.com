### Brief

We constantly generate crumbs of data on the internet. What if we could take everything we do and create an event history timeline.

This would require gathering data from numerous sources and distilling each event down to a snipped which links back to the source.

### Issues

* Even for my own uses this would require integrating with numerous systems some of which may not want to readily give up the data.
* Even if the whole thing works, what use does it really provide? The information would only be mildy interesting to myself and probably not much at all to anyone else
