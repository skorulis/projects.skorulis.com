### Brief

Let's the user set up activities that need to be repeated on a regular basis in order to build and maintain a routine.

Each activity can be setup to complete a number of times per day, week, month or year. 

The app gives a list of upcoming activities that need to be completed and provides notification when time is running out.

As each activity comes up it can either be completed, skipped or pushed back to the next time period. 

# Opportunities

This project could benefit greatly from a widget which is something that I haven't experimented with recently. 

It's also going to need local notifications, which is less interesting but overall gives a nice integration into Apple frameworks.
