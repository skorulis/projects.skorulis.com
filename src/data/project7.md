### Brief

Let's the user set up activities that need to be repeated on a regular basis in order to build and maintain a routine.

Each activity can be setup to complete a number of times per day, week, month or year. 

The app gives a list of upcoming activities that need to be completed and provides notification when time is running out.

As each activity comes up it can either be completed, skipped or pushed back to the next time period.
