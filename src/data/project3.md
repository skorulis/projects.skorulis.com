### Brief

This started as a facebook album where I was taking a photo of every new beer I drank and giving it a rating. The albums are good for sharing with friends but Facebook is terrible for browsing so I couldn't easily lookup whether I had already tried a certain beer.

This project consisted of scripts of fetch all of the images from facebook and then combine them into a single website containing all of the beers I've tried.

It also correlates the facebook text with Untappd beer records so I can pull down more details on the beer like style and country and use that to generate graphs
